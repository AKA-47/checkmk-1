#   like the following:
#   [E1101(no-member), create_rrd] Module 'rrdtool' has no 'create' member
# ldap
#   The Python ldap module gets a lot of constants from the C API which can not be found by pylint.
#   This results in a lot of these errors: "Module 'ldap' has no 'OPT_REFERRALS' member".
# netifaces
#   Can not check methods / attributes of the netifaces C module
