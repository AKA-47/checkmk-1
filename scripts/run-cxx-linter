# changed in the current directory for the given commit. Transform those file
# names into --what-if=... options for make and do a dry run with them. This
# outputs the compilation commands needed, which we massage a bit with grep and
# sed to finally find out which C/C++ we need to check. Brilliant!  :-D  ;-)
