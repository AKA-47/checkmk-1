# Dictionary values sometimes exced the line length limit and are thus
# placed in a new line. But at the same time all dictionary elements follow
# this format to guard uniformity. This is inconvenient since we trade
# convenience at readtime(because short length values still appear in new
# lines) for format uniformity. Therefore we enforce dictionary values to
# remain on same line.

# We do not use i18n comments. Therefore we allow yapf to also format these things.
