*** Components

** Agent base functionality
    check_mk_agent.cc     - Main entry point of the agent. Initialises things, opens network
                            connections, drives the section output, ...
    Environment           - Wraps information (mostly pathes) passed in through the environment
    Configuration         - Parser for the configuration files (check_mk.ini and check_mk_local.ini)
                            Originally this also held the configuration data
    Configurable          - High-Level abstraction for configuration. Each Configurable object
                            represents a configurable parameter, which may be aggregated from
                            multiple lines from the ini.
    SettingsCollector     - Helper classes for Configurables that abstract away some of the
                            peculiarities of using two ini files. This originally contained
                            predecessor classes for Configurable, hence the incorrect name.
                            ---
                            This contains two sets of classes: BlockMode and AddMode. Both
                            are aspects attached to a Configurable. The BlockMode controls
                            how/if settings from different files overwrite each other, the
                            AddMode controls how settings from different files are combined
                            (appended, appended but with data from the second file prepended
                            to that of the first file, ...)
    Section               - Base class for all section wrappers
    SectionManager        - Holds the list of Sections (see below) and configuration on which
                            sections get generated
** Sections
    sections/*            - Implementations of section wrappers.
                            Each Section implements a separate API/functionality to get at
                            data from the os. Most sections require a separate interface but
                            some (wmi, perfcounter) can be used to get at information about
                            different components
    sections/SectionGroup - Proxy-Section that allows handling several section as one unit,
                            i.e. so they can be collectively disabled
    plugins/*             - Various bundled plugins (scripts)
                            Currently, all plugins are handled in the agent by a single
                            Section-object (SectionPluginGroup) It would be neater if each
                            plugin was handled by a separate Section.
** Wrappers for various APIs
    Crypto                - Wrapper for windows crypto API
    ExternalCmd           - Wrapper for process starting/stoping
    EventLog              - Wrapper for windows eventlog API
                            (implementation variants for two separate APIs with common interface)
    PerfCounter           - Wrapper for windows performance counter API
                            (implementation variants for two separate APIs, currently no common
                            interface but shared code in PerfCounterCommon)
    wmiHelper             - Wrapper for windows wmi API
    ListenSocket          - Wrapper for listening network socket (6556)
    Thread                - Wrapper for windows threading api (very basic)
    WinApi(Adaptor)       - Wrapper for all windows API calls
** Other helpers
    OHMMontior            - Manages the OpenHardwareMonitorCLI process for SectionOHM
    OutputProxy           - proxy for the regular agent output
                            (subclasses implement buffering and encryption)
    Logger                - logging utility (implementation from CMC / livestatus)
    RotatingFileHandler   - (log)file rotation utility
    stringutil            - helper functions for string operations (some very crude, some are
                            probably obsolete)
    types                 - declaration of data types 
    CrashHandler          - produces backtraces on crashes
    dynamic_func          - small helper to get function handles dynamically
                            (for those functions not available on all windowses)
    WritableFile          - Wrapper for managing (a) writable file handle(s) over WinAPI

** Tests
    test/*                - Unit tests (Google Test / Google Mock) for Windows agent
    test/section          - Unit tests for section wrappers
    it/*                  - Integration tests (pytest) using a remote Windows VM

** Remaining files are not part of the agent
    perftest.cc           - commandline tool to test perfcounter interface (old api)
    pdhtest.cc            - commandline tool to test perfcounter interface (pdh api)
    wmitest.cc            - commandline tool to test wmi interface
    openhardwaremonitor   - The sources for our modified (headless) version of the open
                            hardware monitor (available under the MPL).
                            However, this is not built from the makefile, the OHM bundled
                            with omd is build from the same sources but on our build
                            system.

*** Building

** Compilation dependencies

Currently mingw-w64 5.0.3 (http://mingw-w64.org), based on gcc 7.2.0, is used to build the agent.
The compilation uses GNU autotools and takes place within a chroot jail. The bash script
'make-agent' (sudo necessary!) is used for setting up the chroot jail and executing the desired
build steps within it.

** Build output

The default make ('sudo ./make-agent' without parameters) generates 4 binaries (2 for x86, 2 for
x64):
    check_mk_agent.exe             (debugging symbols removed)
    check_mk_agent-64.exe          (debugging symbols removed)
    wmitest.exe                    (debugging symbols removed)
    wmitest-64.exe                 (debugging symbols removed)

In order to create executables with all debugging symbols (that is, without stripping the symbols
during the installation step), please call 'sudo ./make-agent install'.

Object files and other intermediate build artifacts are stored in the subdirectories "build" and
"build64".

Unit tests are by default executed at the end of each build (make-agent without parameters). Unit
tests (only 64 bit) can be built and run exclusively using 'sudo ./make-agent unittest'.

Integration tests can be run using 'sudo ./make-agent integrationtest'. In order to do this, special
SSH keys must be generated for the current user without password and saved as
~/.ssh/id_rsa_windows_test[.pub]

** Debugging

* Debugger: mingw gdb
* Profiling: Very Sleepy
* Memory debugging: Dr. Memory

*** MSI

during the make project, the msitools are downloaded if necessary and a msi is generated.
