Title: Fixed Check_MK check helper crashes related to loading of precompiled checks

The latest versions no longer read checks as plain text python files (Werk 6046).
The operation which generates the precompilated file was not atomic, so a file could
be partially written, while being read by another process.
This caused various exceptions in multiple checks.
