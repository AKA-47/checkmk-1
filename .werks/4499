Title: Agent Updater: Prevent broken state files caused by incomplete writes

When the agent updater is being executed it writes it's current deployment state
to a state file. When the system is turned of suddenly it could cause a file
corruption of the cmk-update-agent.state file. We prevent this now by writing to
a temporary file first, flush it and then move it over to the state file path.
