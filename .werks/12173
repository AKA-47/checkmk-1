For some tables ("comments" / "log") and some aggregated columns (like
"num_services" or "worst_service_state") in the tables "hosts" /
"hostgroups" / "servicegroups", the service authorization was always
"loose", regardless of the global setting.  As a consequence, some users
could see too many comments and log entries, and some aggregated values
didn't match what they were seeing elsewhere.  This has been fixed.
