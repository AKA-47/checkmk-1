Some FSC devices report the operational status and type of the interfaces as a
human readable string. As defined in the IF-MIB Check_MK expects the values
ifOperStatus and ifType in SNMP syntax.
The check plugin {{fsc_if64}} was create just for converting these values. One
side effect was that all needed OIDs were fetched two times:
<ul>
<li>for the fsc_if64 check plugin and</li>
<li>for the if64 check plugin as well.</li>
</ul>

Thus fsc_if64 is deprecated now and human readable strings for operational
status and type are handled by if64 for ALL devices.
