The Oracle agent plugin (both Linux and Windows) ignored offline datafiles
for version 12.1 and above. This affected environments with physical standby
databases. Instead of CRIT, the corresponding check plugin
<tt>oracle_recovery_status</tt> went stale. This has been fixed.

For this werk to come into effect, you have to update the Oracle agent plugin
on affected hosts.
