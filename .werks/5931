Title: Fixed "skipping unimplemented check" warning message of active checks
Level: 1
Component: wato

Class: fix

If an active check was disabled via the rule "Disabled services"
and then readmitted to the list of monitored services of the host
on the service discovery page, this active check was falsely stored
to the related autochecks file which caused above warning message.
