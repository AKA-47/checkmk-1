Title: docker_node_images: Improved performance of agent section creation

Class: fix

The agent section generating code has been reworked for better performance.
You will have to update the agent to get this improvement. In case you use
the old agent with the new check, you will get no image label information.

The agent is not processing all images anymore. It skips the intermediate
images (were shown as "<none>:<none>" before).
