Title: Fix Windows agent crash with logwatch and '*' wildcard

Class: fix

Windows agent crashed due to globbing wildcard '*' bringing
in directories when using logwatch. Re-implemented the fix
already done in master also for 1.2.8 (code histories
diverged due to a large refactoring done in Windows agent
for 1.4.0).
