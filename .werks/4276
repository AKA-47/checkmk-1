In previous versios the actions of the Event Console could only get the
variables of the events via substitution of macros.

These information are now also available as environment variables with
the prefix <tt>EVENT_</tt>. For example the text of the event is available as
<tt>EVENT_TEXT</tt> as environment variable.
