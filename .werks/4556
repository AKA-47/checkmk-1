Title: Fixed compatibility problem in agent updater with some older windows versions

When running Check_MK agent updater under some older Windows versions (eg. Windows XP),
a problem with some missing runtime libraries can possibly occur.
This would result in an error message beginning with "Error loading Python DLL:..."

A quick-fix for this problem would be the installation of a Microsoft Visual C++
Redistributable package. It can be found at Microsoft support homepage.
(support.microsoft.com) with the search term "vcredist_x86".
The MS VC++ 2008 Redistributable Package (x86) would be sufficient.

However, the needed runtime libraries will be included in all Check_MK
releases containg this werk.
