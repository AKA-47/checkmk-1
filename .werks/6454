Title: Fixed "tree_spec" exception in virtual host tree snapin with older configs

Old definitions (pre 1.5) of virtual host tree configs could lead to an error "tree_spec"
in the virtual host tree snapin. These configs are now migrated correctly.

A workaround could be to update the virtual host tree global setting by hand.
