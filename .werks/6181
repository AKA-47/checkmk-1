Title: Improved execution of agent in containers
Level: 1
Component: checks

Class: fix

When the docker command is available in a container and the Check_MK agent is
executed in this container while it was started from the node, it does not
execute the docker logic.

The REMOTE environment variable was not set correctly in previous 1.5 releases.
