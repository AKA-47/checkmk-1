It is now possible so set the environment variable TMPDIR in the context of the execution
of the Check_MK Agent. This can be configured within the Agent ruleset "Installation paths
for agent files (Linux, UNIX).


Some agent commands or plugins may follow the environment variable TMPDIR for storage of
temporary files.  For some reasons, you might want to adapt this path. Namely, the agent
updater won't work with a "\tmp" dir that is mounted with a "noexec"-flag. Please note
that the Check_MK Agent does no automatic cleaning on this custom path.
