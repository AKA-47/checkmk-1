When time periods are configured in the ruleset "Check period for passive
Check_MK services", this made the cmc fail on start. The normal behaviour of
Checkmk is to create a warning message like "WARNING: The
cmc_passive_check_period "PERIOD" used by service "old;Check_MK Discovery" does
not exist, falling back to 24x7." and continue.

This is done for all other time period references, but did not work for this
specific option. The fallback has now also been added to this options.
