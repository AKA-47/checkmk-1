Title: Fix statistics reported by Event Console
Level: 1

Class: fix

The usage statistics that are visible to the user using the "Event console performance" sidebar
and the "OMD [SITE] Event Console" services were reporting incorrect values. The single values
were simply mixed up between the different performance values resulting in e.g. incoming messages
being reported as dropped messages and so on.

This issue affected all previous 1.5 releases.
