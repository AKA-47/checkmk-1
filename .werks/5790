Title: Fixed broken calculation of correct host check command
Level: 2
Component: checks

Class: fix

The host check commands <tt>Assume always to be up</tt>, <tt>Use the status of ...</tt> and <tt>TCP connect</tt>
did not work properly, when the host had no explicit IPv4 address set. This has been fixed.
