Title: Windows: allow whitespace in eventlog event source
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.8p27
Date: 1513674478
Class: fix

In version 1.2.8, whitespace in event source name produced the error
message "The system cannot find the path specified." The reason was
premature formatting of the event source name for output by replacing
spaces with underscore, which led to failure when trying to find the
DLL for translating the eventlog message. The bug is no longer present
in version 1.4.0.
