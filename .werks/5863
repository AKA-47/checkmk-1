Title: Windows agent sections: Fixed incompatibility with rules created before 1.4.0p14
Level: 1
Component: wato
Compatible: compat

Version: 1.4.0p26

Class: fix

The werk 5378 (1.4.0p14) renamed an agent section from "webservices" to "wmi_webservices" to fix
a bug. Rules created with the previous definition could not be translated to the new ruleset.
The translation has now been added to be able to edit the old rules again.
