The mknotifyd used specific names for a temporary file which was not excluded by
the mkbackup mechanism. When a backup was performed while the mknotifyd wrote it's
state file, the backup could fail with an exception like this:

OSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: \'/omd/sites/int_ma_5351/var/log/mknotifyd.state.new\'
