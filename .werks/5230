If you configured a "Logwatch Event Console Forwarding" rule and used the
setting "No forwarding" (Messages are handled by logwatch), the logfiles weren't handled
by logwatch at all. They simply got dropped.

This has been fixed. If you update to this version you might see an increase
in logwatch checks, if you used the "No forwarding" setting.
