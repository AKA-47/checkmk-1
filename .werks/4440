Title: check_sftp: New Check for SFTP Connections
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Edition: cre
Version: 1.5.0i1
Date: 1488271633
Class: feature

With this new active check you are able to verify successful logins and
optionally a timestamp of a file or operability of getting/putting a file.

This plugin needs the python libary paramiko and is therefore not out of
the box compatible with older releases of Check_MK.
