If a user is not allowed to activate foreign changes but wants to
perform a service discovery of hosts configured on slave sites,
this action was falsely forbidden by Check_MK showing
<tt>There are some changes made by your colleagues that you can not
activate because you are not permitted to. You can only activate
the changes on the sites that are not affected by these changes.</tt>
Only if the user wants to activate these changes and does not have
the right permissions the above warning message should be displayed.
