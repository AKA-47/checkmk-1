Under certain circumstances crash dumps can lead to failed notifications with the corresponding
error message "OSError: [Errno 7] Argument list too long" in the notify.log. The error appears
if the environment passed to notification script is too large. To avoid this issue the
long, base64 encoded strings in the LONGSERVICEOUTPUT and LONGSERVICEOUTPUT_HTML of crash dumps
are now replaced by short error messages.
