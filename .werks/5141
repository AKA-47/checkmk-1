Web-API calls which set/update specific elements in WATO had trouble interpreting the incoming data.


JSON encoded data is not fully capable to represent the python syntax - in detail tuples, it uses lists instead.
WATO raises an error when a list is reported and a tuple is expected. For example, this error may happen when
you set a SNMPv3 community for a specific host (the community is configured as tuple).


This werk introduces the <tt>request_format=python</tt> parameter.
If set, the request is parsed as python instead of json code.
