Title: chrony: Fixed incompatibility with RedHat 7.5
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Edition: cre
Version: 1.4.0p31
Date: 1524491173
Class: fix

The SELinux rules shipped with RedHat 7.5 deny execution of chronyc like
our agent did before. We have changed the agent code to be able to also
work with RedHat 7.5 out of the box.
