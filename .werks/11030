Class: fix

If already discovered Services are not existing any more, e.g. if you used a
mkp package and removed it, the discovery page crashed with an error message
like "Service discovery failed for this host: Got invalid data: Invalid check
parameter string 'None'". From now on, such services are skipped during
discovery.
