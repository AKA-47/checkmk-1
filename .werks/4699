Level: 2
Component: wato

Class: feature

You can now configure all rules which are available in the <i>Host & Service Parameters Page</i>
through the use of two Web-API calls.


Important: Right now the interface is only able to speak the python language.<br>
The existing output_format parameter, as well as the new request parameter <tt>request_format</tt>
must both be set to <tt>python</tt>. An additional interface language is planned, maybe XML.
Furthermore, these API calls are intended for admin use only, since they modify the entire
ruleset in all folders.


<tt>get_rulesets_info</tt><br>
This API call does not require any additional info. It simply returns a list of all available rulesets.
Each entry of this list is a dictionary which includes information about the title, the help text, the item
help text and the how often the rule is used.


<tt>get_ruleset</tt>br>
Requires the request key <tt>ruleset_name</tt>, which specifies the ruleset to query.
This API call returns exactly one complete ruleset of all folders, so you can't query differnt types.
The response itself has an extra key configuration_hash, which can be used in the following call.


<tt>set_ruleset</tt>br>
The previous call provided a dict with the ruleset configuration. This call expect the same format
in the request object. You can modify the modify the previously queried dict and send it back through this
f you also sent the configuration_hash parameter, the Web-API will check if the configuration has changed
in the meantime. If so, the set_ruleset call will fail. When no configuration_hash parameter is sent,
no checking will be done.
