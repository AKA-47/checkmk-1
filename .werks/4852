Title: Livestatus connections: fixed bug where data from previous connection got reused
Level: 1
Component: livestatus

Class: fix

When using persistent connections, there was a risk that the response data from
previous livestatus queries got intermingled with the data from the latest query.


This caused quite a lot of confusing for most of the GUI plugins, which crashed occasionally.
