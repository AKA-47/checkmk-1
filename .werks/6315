Title: mssql_backup: Fixed missing default levels
Level: 2
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Edition: cre
Version: 1.5.0b10

Class: fix

Werk 6143 removed the empty default levels. The consequence was that
all passive checks were gone because the default levels variable name
was unknown to Check_MK und therefore the autochecks could not be read.
This was introduced in Check_MK version in 1.5.0b8.
