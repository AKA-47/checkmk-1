If you use the old pnp4nagios format with one metric per RRD, the core needs
to create/update an XML description for each RRD from time to time.  To
avoid creation/update storms after e.g. reloads or mass imports of new
hosts, this work should be spread over several (currently 10) minutes.  Due
to a bug this spreading didn't work, which has been fixed.
