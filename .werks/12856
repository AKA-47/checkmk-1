If ServiceNow notifications are used in distributed environments the host and
service problem ID might not be unique, because every site core creates own
host and service problem IDs. This could lead to problems with ticket creation
if the notifications end up at the same ServiceNow instance because the problem
ID might already have been used.

If you use such setup, please configure the new option "Use site ID prefix" in the
notification rule for ServiceNow. The notification script will then set the
host and service problem ID and the site name on creation.

If ServiceNow notifications are send from one site to one ServiceNow instance
or from different sites to different ServiceNow instances, no action is
required. The Script will use the old mechanism of setting and checking for
host and service problem IDs.
