Title: Raw Edition: Improved handling of configuration errors
Level: 2
Component: core
Compatible: compat

Class: fix


While creating a configuration for the Nagios core (e.g. using "cmk -U" or during "omd update")
exceptions may be raised which are caused by configuration issues.

When using the Nagios core Check_MK does not produce a half written object file anymore. In case
of such an error Check_MK throws away everything and keeps the old file.

You can then start the site with the old configuration and fix the configuration issue while the
monitoring is running with the old config.
