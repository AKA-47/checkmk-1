Title: Agent Bakery: Fixed missing baked packages

Class: fix

During the agent bake process some previously generated symlinks went missing.
The baking itself went fine, but the symlinks pointing to the bake result were no longer available.
As a result, the agent bakery GUI showed some packages as "Not available".
This is a preliminary fix, until we find the root cause of this problem.

There is also a console workaround for this problem.
Agent baking will always succeed with the command <tt>cmk -v --bake-agents</tt>
Keep in mind, that you need to sign the agents afterwards.
