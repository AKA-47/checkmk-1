Title: Crash reports: Filter out password/_password from HTTP vars of GUI crashes

When a crash occurs during the login procedure where a user entered his password during
verification of this password, the crash could contain this password in plain text in
the HTTP variable data structure. The vars named password/_password are now explicitly
filtered to prevent this.
