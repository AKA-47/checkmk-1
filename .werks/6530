Title: Fixed possible error "You can not override a builtin auxiliary tag" after update
Level: 1
Component: multisite
Compatible: compat

Version: 1.5.0p3

Class: fix

During the tag migration from 1.5 or newer a problem could happen that the auxiliary
tags "snmp" and "tcp" were not removed correctly. This happened when the titles of these
auxiliary tags have been changed in the site.

This is a regression since 1.5.0p1 (caused by #6247).

Workaround with 1.5.0p2 or older: Have a look at the
/omd/sites/[SITE]/etc/check_mk/multisite.d/wato/hosttags.mk file.  First create
a backup of this file, then look for entries like this:

wato_aux_tags += \
[('snmp', u'monitor via SNMP'), ('tcp', u'monitor via Check_MK Agent')]

Try to remove the line and reload the GUI. The issue should be gone now.
