When opening the dialog "Sign all agents" there was previously a search field shown which had
the initial focus. A user would expect to have the initial focus on the key pass phrase field
to sign the agent. When the user starts typing the pass phrase without previously changing the
focus, the pass phrase becomes visible on the screen.

To fix this we have now removed the search field from the "Sign all agents" dialog. The pass
phrase field in now initially focused as intended.
