Title: PS: Crash when zombie processes are found on Solaris
Level: 1
Component: checks
Class: fix

Solaris agent returns "-" as cputime on zombie processes. This produced a
crash since it cannot be converted to a time. This Werk put such input into
consideration and transforms it to zero cputime, letting the PS check work
normally.
