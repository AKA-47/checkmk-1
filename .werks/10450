Title: cisco_temperature: don't block on large precisions
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Edition: cre
Version: 1.5.0p24

Class: fix

On devices which delivered a large number for the precision in the
OID .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.91.1.1.1.1.3 the check plugin blocked consuming
100% CPU. As a result the discovery and check execution on such
devices will not be possible. To be noticeable a value must be larger
than 1'000'000. The larger the value is the more severe the effect
will be. As a workaround the check can be deactivated on the affected
hosts.
