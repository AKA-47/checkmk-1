Title: Fixed creation of default "local" site
Level: 1
Component: wato
Compatible: compat
Edition: cre
Version: 1.4.0p7

Class: fix

Previous 1.4 versions were creating a new distributed monitoring site
when there did not exist a site named exactly like the site ID of the
central site.

WATO now only creates this default site entry when there is no site
configured at all.
