The activate changes procedure determining the relevant files for each site was way too slow.
This update improved the overall activate changes performance by a factor of at least 100.
An example setup with 40 remote sites now takes around 2 seconds instead of 300.
Keep in mind, there are still other functions which are triggered during an activate changes.
Their performance will be improved in the next innovation version.
