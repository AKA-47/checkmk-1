When viewing the list of rules in a ruleset via WATO, it shows the rules grouped by folder.
When the user views a transitive folder the rules defined in child folders were not listed.

It has now been changed to work like this: The list shows all rules of all parent and
all child folders. Folders of other, not involved, branches in the folder hierarchy
are not displayed.
