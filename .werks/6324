Title: Notifications: Fixed height of graph area with a larger legend

Class: fix

Graphs with a lot of metrics need more space for their legend. This larger
legend did not increase the size of the graph images. They reduced the size
of the graph are and finally destroyed the graph layout.

The image height is now increased with a larger number of metrics.
