Title: Improved validation of timeperiods before deletion
Level: 1
Component: wato

Class: fix

When deleting a timeperiod via WATO some validations are made that this
time period is not used anymore and can be deleted without issues.

In previous versions this check was checking this places:

<ul>
<li>Host & service rules like service / host notification and check periods</li>
<li>Notification period in user profiles</li>
<li>Timeperiod exclusions in other timeperiods</li>
</ul>

These missing validations have been added now:

<ul>
<li>Timeperiod condition in notification and alerting rules</li>
<li>Bulk operation in notification rules</li>
<li>Timeperiod condition in Event Console rules</li>
<li>Host & service rules: time specific parameters</li>
</ul>
