Some dropdown (select) fields were broken in Check_MK 1.5.0 for a longer time,
especially in WATO configuration dialogs. This issue existed in all previous
1.5.0 releases.

E.g. when setting the "Match syslog priority" option in a Event Console rule,
the selected option was not persisted as expected.
