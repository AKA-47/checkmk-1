Title: cmk-update-agent: Handle Windows encoding

Class: fix

When running the agent updater on windows command line, special (non-ASCII) input characters
were not handled properly. This is now mitigated by applying proper codepages to input
from command line arguments and the user's stdin-input.

Please note that there might still occur some issues with special characters within the
windows command line, caused by limitations of the underlying shell,
depending on your system's configuration.
