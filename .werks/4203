Title: Fix failed SSH login in Linux remote alert handlers on some distributions
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.4.0b2

Class: fix

When the baked agent package automatically creates the SSH access for
executing remote alert handlers by modifying <tt>.ssh/authorized_keys</tt>
it puts two spaces instead of just one after the word <tt>ssh-rsa</tt>. This
seems to make <b>some</b> versions of SSH unhappy and ignore that key. This
has been fixed. You need to rebake and reinstall your agents in order to
fix that after updating Check_MK.

As a workaround you can manually remove the duplicate space in
<tt>.ssh/authorized_keys</tt> in the home directory of the target user.
