Title: Wiondows agent sections: Fixed incompatibility with rules created before 1.4.0p22
Level: 1
Component: wato
Compatible: compat
Edition: cee
Version: 1.4.0p26
Date: 1519389923
Class: fix

The werk 5415 (1.4.0p22) renamed an agent section from "ohm" to "openhardwaremonitor" to fix
a bug. Rules created with the previous definition could not be translated to the new ruleset.
The translation has now been added to be able to edit the old rules again.
