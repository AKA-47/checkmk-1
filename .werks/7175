Title: Fixed exception when trying to export agent output for non WATO hosts

Class: fix

The actions "Fetch agent output" and "Fetch SNMP walk" can only be used for hosts
managed by WATO for distributed sites. The error message for non WATO hosts could
not be displayed correctly and resulted in a crash which is fixed now.
