Class: feature

In addition to the already returned keys <tt>aux_tags</tt>, <tt>tag_groups</tt> and <tt>configuration_hash</tt>,
the API call now also returns key <tt>builtin</tt> which includes the unmodifiable tags.
This <tt>builtin</tt> key is not part of the configuration_hash checksum, since you cannot change these settings anyway.
