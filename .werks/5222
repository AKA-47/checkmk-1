Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Edition: cee
Version: 1.4.0p13
Date: 1506002395
Class: fix

A change in the bakelet's parameters introduced in 1.4.0i1 (cf. Werk #3137)
led to previously configured rules blocking the baking process as well as
leading to errors when searching for rulesets. This has been fixed.
