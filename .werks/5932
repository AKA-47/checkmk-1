If a TCP host has additionally a SNMP management board data source
in Check_MK this board discovers suitable SNMP checks.

But if there's a SNMP host which also has a SNMP management board
Check_MK must know which discovered check type belongs to which
data source. Therefore we have to create new checks for SNMP
management boards.

The following check types support SNMP management boards:
- mgmt_fsc_sc2_cpu_status
- mgmt_fsc_sc2_mem_status
- mgmt_fsc_sc2_fans
- mgmt_fsc_sc2_power_consumption
- mgmt_fsc_sc2_info
- mgmt_fsc_sc2_temp
- mgmt_fsc_sc2_voltage
- mgmt_dell_poweredge_cpu
- mgmt_dell_poweredge_mem
- mgmt_dell_poweredge_netdev
- mgmt_dell_poweredge_pci
- mgmt_dell_poweredge_status
- mgmt_dell_poweredge_psu
- mgmt_dell_poweredge_fans
- mgmt_dell_poweredge_amperage.power
- mgmt_dell_poweredge_temp
- mgmt_hp_proliant_da_cntlr
- mgmt_hp_proliant_cpu
- mgmt_hp_proliant_fans
- mgmt_hp_proliant_mem
- mgmt_hp_proliant_temp
- mgmt_snmp_info
