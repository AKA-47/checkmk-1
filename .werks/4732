Title: systemd: Don't kill child processes of the agent

Class: fix

When running the Check_MK agent via systemd the asynchronous executed
agent plugins and real time checks were not working correctly since the
systemd was terminating all child processes after the agent finished.

The systemd configuration has now been changed to let the child processes
be alive after the agent exited.
