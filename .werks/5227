Title: Checkgroup humidity: Fix swapped lower levels and definition of only one kind of levels
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Edition: cre
Version: 1.4.0p19
Date: 1510751624
Class: fix

Previously, all checks of the checkgroup humidity would crash if only lower or only upper levels
were configured. Lower levels configured in the GUI would be swapped in the check, ie the
warn level would be interpreted as the crit level and vice versa. This has been fixed.
