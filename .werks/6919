This werk fixes a regression introduced with 1.5.0p8 which
broke Livestatus filtering when using the Nagios core. The
CEE / Microcore is not affected by this issue.

The issue broke all livestatus queries that were using the
Filter header together with the equal operator and a value
containing regex special characters like the dot. The result
set of such a query was always empty.

A symptom reported by multiple users was that the context menu
of logwatch services (with a dot in it's name) was not shown
anymore.
