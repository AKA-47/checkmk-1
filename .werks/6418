Title: Fix a crash during notification cancelling

When a notification was cancelled and the cancelling rule contained
more contacts than the notification that was going to be cancelled
the processing of notifications raised an exception. As a result
no further notifications were processed.

The exception was raised e.g. if a notification for the contact "ab"
was cancelled for the users "ab" and "cd" using the option "The
following users" in the contact selection.

With this werk the issue is fixed.
