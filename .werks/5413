Title: Windows agent: nocontext tag did not work for multibyte encoded logfiles

If a Windows logfile was encoded with a multibyte character encoding
the nocontext flag had no effect, always outputting the full context.

The nocontext tag now works correctly, in a way similar to single-byte
encoded logfiles.
