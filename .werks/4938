Title: Make sure that a notification has the plugin output available

Plugin output in notifications can be either host-related or service-related.
Make sure that the resulting notification has always access to the right
kind.  Previously notifications triggered e.g. by the event console could
have an empty plugin output.

Note: This was a bug introduced in 1.4.0p6, earlier versions were not
affected.
