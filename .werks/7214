Title: Interface checks: Introduce scan function API
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: incomp
Edition: cre
Version: 1.6.0i1
Date: 1552033415
Class: feature

In the past conflicting check plugins with services called "Interface <ITEM>"
could lead to a "duplicate services" warning on the discovery page.

To avoid this issue in the future, all scan functions for those plugins
are now located in the file "if.include".
If you add a new "Interface <ITEM>"- service, please add the corresponding
scan function to the file "if.include", and list in the dictionary
<tt>_SPECIFIC_IF_SCANS</tt>. You can then access the scan function by specifying
<tt> 'snmp_scan_function': get_snmp_if_scan_function('my_if_check')</tt>
in your check plugin.
The matching devices will then be automatically excluded from the generic if
and if64 check plugin.
