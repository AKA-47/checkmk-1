The Kubernetes API provides timestamps for the k8s_stats checks
in the RFC3339Nano format with different timezones and a varying
number of trailing zeros in the seconds field. This lead to
a crash of the k8s_stats.network check. To resolve this issues
the timestamps are now converted to unix timestamps in the
special agent.
