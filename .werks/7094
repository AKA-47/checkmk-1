Example:
A TCP host with a SNMP management board discovers two uptime services:
{{Uptime}} and {{Management Interface: Uptime}}.
With these incorrectly discovered host only services the {{Uptime}} graph got
data from {{Management Interface: Uptime}} service. The graph displayed some
peeks in arbitray intervals.
