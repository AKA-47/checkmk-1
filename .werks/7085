Title: Fixed parsing of special syslog messages which don't contain a host name
Level: 1
Component: ec
Class: fix
Compatible: incomp
Edition: cre
State: unknown
Version: 1.5.0p13
Date: 1550050614

The Event Console is now able to process syslog messages that don't contain the
host name field. An example for such a message is this one:

C+:
Feb 13 08:41:07 pfsp: The configuration was changed on leader blatldc1-xxx to version 1.1366 by blatldc1-xxx/admin at 2019-02-13 09:41:02 CET</tt>
C-:

In previous versions messages like this resulted in log messages like this in
the event console log (var/log/mkeventd.log):

C+:

A fallback event was created that had no syslog fields set and contained the
whole unparsed syslog message in the text field.  If you have EC rules matching
on this fallback event, you will have to change these rules to match the parsed
event fields.
