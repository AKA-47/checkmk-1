Title: mk_jolokia: CA default for https connection
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: incomp
Edition: cre
Version: 1.5.0p8
Date: 1542121791
Class: fix

The previous default value for "cert_path" in the mk_jolokia
plugin configuration led to a crash.

The new default is 'None' which means the server certificate is
ignored altogether.
