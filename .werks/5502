Title: Prevent baked tar.gz agents from changing ownership of files on host

Class: fix

When extracting a tar.gz packaged agent from the agent bakery as root (as it is normallly done), the user and group ownerships of the extracted files would be set to the Check_MK site user, if such user is available on the target host. This would lead to a wrong ownership on some folders like "/etc", "/usr" and "/var".

In order to prevent this, the agent bakery now creates the tar.gz packages correctly by setting an ownership of "root".
