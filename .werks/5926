Werk #2656 added the options to use WMI for retrieving information
about process on Windows and to display the full path of the process.
These new configuration options were left without the counterpart for
configuring them in the Agent Bakery.

This deficit is now fixed so that the option use_wmi for the ps section
is also configurable through the Agent Bakery. The full path option is
now also configurable, nevertheless enabling it only takes effect if
use_wmi is also enabled.
