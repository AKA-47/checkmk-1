Title: Fixed debian agent package incompatibilities (1.4.0p34 regression)
Level: 1
Component: core
Compatible: compat
Edition: cre
Version: 1.4.0p35
Date: 1531217694
Class: fix

The debian agent package shipped with Check_MK (located in share/check_mk/agent/*.deb) was
not compatible with older Debian/Ubuntu version because it used xz as compression algorithm
for the control files.

When trying to install such a package an error like this occurred:

dpkg-deb: error: archive 'check-mk-agent_1.4.0p34-1_all.deb' contains not understood data member control.tar.xz, giving up

We have now changed the compression of the whole package to gzip which should make the package
compatible to such systems again.
