Title: Implicit default values for agent updater config
Level: 1
Component: agents
Compatible: compat

Class: fix

Some fields, namely the update interval and the proxy configuration (new since 1.5) are optional within the agent updater plugin configuration.
With this werk, a default value of 3600 seconds for the interval and a default behavior of "ignore proxy settings" is assumed in the case that these fields are not set by the user.
This matches the behavior of previous Check_MK releases.
