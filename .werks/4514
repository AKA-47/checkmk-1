Level: 1
Component: agents
Class: fix
Compatible: compat
Edition: cee
State: unknown
Version: 1.4.0b5

The debian packages created by the agent bakery contained the whole
agent configuration. This could contain secrets that should not be
available with the description, e.g. when using the alert handlers.
