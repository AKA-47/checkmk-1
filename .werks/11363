The 64-bit version of the interface check for switch ports can be configured
to also monitor the admin status <tt>ifAdminStatus</tt>. If this option is
activated, checkmk uses the check plugin <tt>if64adm</tt> instead of
<tt>if64</tt>. Up to now, only an <tt>ifAdminStatus</tt> of 2 was reported by
setting the port state to <i>9 - admin down</i>. With this werk, the admin
status is now monitored completely separately from the port state. Consequently,
the port state <i>9 - admin down</i> is not available any more.

Previously, the monitoring of the admin state was activated implicitly by configuring
checkmk to discover ports in the state <i>9 - admin down</i> (rule "Network Interface
and Switch Port Discovery"). Now, this is handled in a separate rule: "SNMP Interface
check: Monitor ifAdminStatus (use 'if64adm' instead of 'if64')". If and only if this
rule is activated, the admin status will be monitored, independently of the
configuration in "Network Interface and Switch Port Discovery".

Furthermore, since the admin status is now reported separately from the port state,
it can also be used to configure 1) the discovery of network interfaces (rule "Network
Interface and Switch Port Discovery"), 2) the monitoring state (rule "Network interfaces
and switch ports"). For example, you can make checkmk discover only interfaces with
an admin status of 2 or you can set the monitoring state of all interfaces with an
amdin status of 1 to WARNING. Note that these configuration options only have an
effect if the admin status is actually monitored, i.e., if the new rule mentioned
above is activated.

This change is incompatible for all users who are currently monitoring the admin
status using <tt>if64adm</tt>. These users should follow these steps:
<ul>
<li>Activate the monitoring of the admin status using the new rule "SNMP Interface
check: Monitor ifAdminStatus (use 'if64adm' instead of 'if64')".
</li>
<li>Check the discovery configuration (rule "Network Interface and Switch Port
Discovery"). As mentioned above, the admin state can now be used to further refine the
discovery of network interfaces. On the other hand, the port state <i>9 - admin down</i>
is not available any more, so users might have to adjust their configurations.</li>
<li>Re-discover the services of affected hosts.</li>
<li>Check the monitoring configuration (rule "Network interfaces and switch ports").
Analogously to the discovery configuration, the admin state can now be used to set
the monitoring state of network interfaces and the port state <i>9 - admin down</i>
is not available any more.</li>
</ul>
