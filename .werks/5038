Class: fix

When using datasource programs (like e.g. special agents or SSH command line calls)
to get agent data from hosts it may happen that these programs remain open as
zombie processes. Check_MK has been extended to deal with this situation and clean
up these processes.

Details: When the program execution takes too long Check_MK sends a SIGTERM to the
process group of the executed program. After sending the signal Check_MK is now
waiting for the process to finish.
