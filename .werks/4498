When using the Check_MK Agent Updater on some systems it could happen
that small temporary files named cmk-update-agent-verify-* could be
left over after program execution in the system temporary paths like
/tmp on Linux and %TEMP% on Windows.

New versions of the updater are now cleaning up the files created during
the agent signature verification. Files created by older versions of the
updater need to be cleaned up manually.
