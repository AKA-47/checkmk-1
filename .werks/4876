Title: mounts: Fixed wrong handling of NFS mounts on Linux which are detected as stale
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Edition: cre
Version: 1.4.0p8

Class: fix

Such mounts are marked with '\040(deleted)' und therefore discovered
as new services while the related services report
{{UNKNOWN - filesystem not mounted}}.

This has been fixed. The service now reports
{{WARN - Mount point detected as stale}}.
