Title: Compatibility fix for windows agent updater

The command cmk-update-agent sometimes fails with an error message like 
"Loadlibrary() argument 1 must be string not unicode error" when running on Windows.
The error cause is an incompatibility within Python 2.7.13 and some Python libraries.
We fix this issue by using Python 2.7.12 instead.
