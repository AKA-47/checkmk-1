When a backup job that has previously been executed is deleted, it left it's
last state file in place. This resulted in Check_MK services monitoring this
never changing state.

To remove state files of already deleted jobs, you can safely delete the file
at /omd/sites/[SITE]/var/check_mk/backup/[JOB].state for site backup jobs and
/var/lib/mkbackup/[JOB].state for appliance system backup jobs.

After deleting this file, you can execute a service discovery on your
monitoring server to remove the vanished backup check.
