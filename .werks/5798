Title: Fixed Check_MK Check Helper file locking errors

Check helpers kept a file lock, whenever the monitored host check ran into a timeout.
As a result other check helpers were never able to get the file lock again and were stuck until the
helper timed out. This effectively brought down the entire check helper pool.

Note:<br>
Since this error only happens when there are hosts with Check_MK check timeouts, it might be
a good idea to increase the check plugin timeout in the configuration - till this version goes live.
