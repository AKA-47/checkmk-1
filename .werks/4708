Title: Windows Agent/Agent Updater: Fixed race condition which removed the windows service

The agent updater could kill itself during an update, because the MSI installation process
sent a shutdown signal to the windows service. This shutdown also killed any plugins,
including the agent updater... This has been fixed by detaching the cmk-update-agent.exe
file from the process group of the windows agent.
