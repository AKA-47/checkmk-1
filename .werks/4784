Title: oracle_rman: wrong detection of level 1 backup
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Edition: cre
Version: 1.4.0p6

Class: fix

The behavior of some v$-Views in 12.1 has been changed.
This could lead to problems when a new Level 0 backup
was done after a Level 1. The calculation for the last Level
1 was wrong and has been fixed.
