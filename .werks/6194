Title: Windows fileinfo: wrong size for files exceeding 4 GB

The sizes of files exceeding 4 GB were displayed wrong as
FILE_SIZE % 4 GB instead of the correct size. The bug was due to a
faulty implementation of C++ std::filesystem::file_size on Windows.
The workaround uses 'old' WinAPI for obtaining the correct file size.
