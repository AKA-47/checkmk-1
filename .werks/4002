Title: BI: Major Rework of Code. Apache processes now share computated data
Level: 2
Component: bi
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.4.0i3
Date: 1481707801
Class: feature

Previously, each apache process had to compile the all BI aggregation trees by itself.
This generated lots of CPU load during core restart, especially on larger BI configurations.

With this update, an apache process no longer computes the BI trees only for personal usage.
The computation results are now shared between the different processes through cache files.

If you encounter any bugs with this new mechanism you can switch back to the old
implementation via the global settings option <i>Use legacy compilation for BI aggregations (slower)</i>.
