If users are only allowed to see folders for which they have
permissions i.e. if the Global Setting "Hide folders without
read permissions" is activated, some sites like e.g. the
notifications of a user could cause long waiting times. The
problem occured especially when users are only allowed to
see the lowest folder level. In some rare cases users could
even run into a GUI timeout.
