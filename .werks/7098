Title: agent_aws: Removed password store in special agent configuration

Class: fix

In the AWS agent configuration you can use the password store but
in Check_MK versions <=1.5.0 the usage of password store in special agents
is not implemented yet.

If you still use the password store in 1.5.0 in the special agent AWS you
get the following error:
TypeError: sequence item 1: expected string, tuple found
