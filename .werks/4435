In the NEB plugin, the pending_flex_downtime column has always been an
integer, although the column comment claimed it was a boolean.  The
Livestatus interface of the Check_MK Micro Core was inconsistent and
returned a boolean.  Furthermore, the calculation of the value was not
totally correct.

Now pending_flex_downtime is always returned as an integer, and the column
comment has been fixed to reflect that.
