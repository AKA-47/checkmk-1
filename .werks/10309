On a new site, when historic perfdata is not yet available and predictive
levels are set, Check goes into UNKN state and delivers no new perfdata,
which makes the problem permanent. Predictive Levels calculation is now
robust against receiving no data at all, and waits until there is enough
data for prediction. The check now continues to output such data.
