Title: BI aggregations: increased render performance
Level: 1
Component: bi
Compatible: compat
Edition: cre
Version: 1.4.0p32

Class: fix

The livestatus data required for rendering the BI tree is no longer fetched consecutive from one site after another.
The new mechanism queries all sites in parallel, hereby increasing the livestatus query performance.
