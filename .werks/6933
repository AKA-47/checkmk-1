Title: Always include xinetd configuration file to .tgz packages

Due to a bug in the packaging routine within the agent bakery, the Check_MK-Agent
xinetd configuration file wouldn't be included into .tgz packages.

This error occured when using the plugin "Installation paths for agent files"
while having no configured path starting with <code>/etc</code>.

The xinetd configuration file under <code>/etc/xinetd.d/</code> will now be included as intended,
regardless of the paths configured at the "Installation paths for agent files" ruleset.
