Title: Fixed audit log not showing todays entries when "current date" is selected

The audit log of WATO shows the entries of the "current date" by default. In some
cases it could happen that the entries of the current day were not shown by default.
The page displayed yesterdays entries instead.

Workaround: Selecting todays date below the option "Start log from" shows the current
entries.
