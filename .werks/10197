Previously Windows Firewall can prevent a connection to the Windows Agent(this 
is the behavior by default) thus forcing a system administrator to configure 
potentially every host with Windows Agent installed.

Now Windows Agent can configure the Windows Firewall self.

There are two possibilities:

- For Windows Agent service you may edit Checkmk configuration file adding 
at the end:
C+:
system:
  firewall: 
    mode: configure
C-:
and restart the Agent service or trigger a configuration reload.

- For exe file, for example, <tt>\path\to\check_mk_agent.exe<\tt> using command line
<tt>\path\to\check_mk_agent.exe fw -configure<\tt>
will configure Firewall correctly for <tt>\path\to\check_mk_agent.exe<\tt>

It is possible to make the agent remove the firewall configuration by setting
the mode option to "clear" in the agent configuration file or by executing
the command <tt>\path\to\check_mk_agent.exe fw -clear<\tt>
