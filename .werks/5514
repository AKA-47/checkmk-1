Title: cmk-update-agent: Use POST-requests for server communications
Level: 1
Component: agents
Class: security
Compatible: compat
Edition: cee

Version: 1.4.0p37

The agent updater now uses POST requests for all communications
to the Check_MK Server.

This improves security because all data, including sensitive data like
login-credentials, are now sent within the HTTP-Body instead of
within the URL. Notably, no sensitive data will ne exposed to the
apache logfiles on the Check_MK server.

This Change is relevant for Check_MK 1.4 only, whereas the agent updater
shiped with Check_MK 1.5 or newer has another code base that employs
POST requests since its first release.
