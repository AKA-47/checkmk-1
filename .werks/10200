Previously, if a timeout occurs in the 'ps' section during WMI query, the agent 
immediately stopped generation of data from all remaining sections. As result,
the monitoring site reported a lots of missing and/or staling services.

Now, in the case of the timeout in the 'ps' section the Agent skips only this 
section.
