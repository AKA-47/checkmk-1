Title: Prevent log entry in web.log on each page access caused by 2.0 cookies
Level: 1
Component: multisite
Compatible: compat

Class: fix

Users which have authentication cookies issued by a Checkmk 2.0 site caused a
log entry on each page access in the web.log. The log message looked like this:
<tt>Exception while checking cookie auth_[site]: ... ValueError: could not
convert string to float:</tt>.

Since the authentication cookies of both versions are not compatible at all,
we now silently skip processing the cookies of Checkmk 2.0 or newer.
