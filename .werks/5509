Title: cmk-update-agent: Prevent agent update from crashing while setting up syslog
Level: 1
Component: agents
Compatible: compat
Edition: cee
Version: 1.5.0p3
Date: 1534508552
Class: fix

If syslog setup failed (on Linux), namely if /dev/log is not available, the agent updater would crash.
This is now mitigated by catching errors while setting up logging to syslog.
A failure will now result in a warning instead of a crash.
