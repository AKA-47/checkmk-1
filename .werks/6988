Title: netstat: Fix crashing check on AIX 7
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Edition: cre
Version: 1.5.0p14
Date: 1553179510
Class: fix

The netstat command separates the port from the IP address with a dot (.) instead
of a colon (:) on some AIX versions, which the check previously could not parse
correctly. This has been fixed.
