Title: dell_compellent_folder: Fix space calculations
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat

Class: fix

Currently, the following MIBs are used:
<ul>
<li>DELL-STORAGE-SC-MIB::scDiskFolderSUTotalSpace2: available space
for the folder</li>
<li>DELL-STORAGE-SC-MIB::scDiskFolderSUFreeSpace: difference between the
configured space and available space</li>
</ul>

Both values (available space and configured space) are configured by
the admin and do not change with the usage of the folder. Instead, the
follwoing MIBs should be used:
<ul>
<li>DELL-STORAGE-SC-MIB::scDiskFolderSUAllocSpace: space allocated to the
folder (i.e. the total space),</li>
<li>DELL-STORAGE-SC-MIB::scDiskFolderSUUsedSpace2: space used by the data
stored in the folder</li>
</ul>

The available space is given by the difference of the two.

This change also makes the check use the standard check parameters for
filesystem checks
