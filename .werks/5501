Title: cmk-update-agent: Fix mistaken server response for Windows Agent Updater
Level: 1
Component: agents

Class: fix

Due to a bug in the handling of the Check_MK server response, a valid downloaded MSI-packaged agent updater can be mistaken as a "login failed" response.

Instead of updating the Windows Agent, the agent updater would display the error message "ERROR: Cannot authenticate, invalid user/passwort/secret." and abort.

In order to restore funtionality to the Agent Updater, please uninstall the Windows Agent on the affected hosts and reinstall with a newly baked MSI-package.
