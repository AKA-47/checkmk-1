Title: Prevent cmk-update-agent from being prelinked on Linux

Since Check_MK 1.5, the Agent Updater gets packaged via the tool "PyInstaller" to ensure a better compatibility. Unfortunately, PyInstaller-packaged binaries will break when tthey get prelinked. You would experience this by getting an error message like

<pre>
Cannot open self /usr/lib/check_mk_agent/plugins/3600/cmk-update-agent or archive /usr/lib/check_mk_agent/plugins/3600/cmk-update-agent.pkg
</pre>

when cmk-update-agent gets executed after a prelink.

To mitigate this problem, and because there may be some systems that run a prelink-job frequently on all executables, the Check_MK agent package now blacklists the cmk-update-agent binary from being prelinked. It does this by writing to the prelink-config (if it finds one on the system) on installation. The corresponding config entries will be removed on uninstallation.
