Changed check specific check and discovery parameters were not
always updated during config reload ("Activate changes"). This
made the Check_MK and Check_MK Discovery services not recognize
the changed parameters when reloading the config. The parameters
were only loaded during next core restart.

This regression affected all previous 1.5 beta releases.
