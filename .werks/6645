The process information delivered by the agent has been upgrated multiple times by requirements of users or information available from the OS. The ps agent tracked the memory outilization of a process by its name, but could not access information of process id and the time of life(elapsed time) of a running process, as such information was misplaced by the agent and thus ignored by the check. This fix brings this data into consideration by the check.
