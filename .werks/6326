When connecting a 1.4 slave site to a Check_MK 1.5 master site an error occurred in the
master control snapin "invalid stats header: table 'eventconsoleevents' has no column 'event_host_in_downtime'".

This was caused by a query that the newer version is sending to all connected sites which
can not be understood by older sites. 1.4 sites starting from 1.4.0p35 can now be connected
with 1.5 sites wihout experiencing this issue.
