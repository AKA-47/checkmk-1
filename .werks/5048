When opening the service discovery page for new hosts that are not monitored via
SNMP yet the page is mostly empty. To get services a click on "full scan" is needed.
Then the host will really be contacted via SNMP.

When doing some specific actions now, like enabling checkboxes or just adding a single
service instead of all no service was shown on the following page.

The full scan mode is now being used for all actions on a discovery page after enabling
it.
