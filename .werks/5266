Class: fix

Due to a code statement that is not supported in Python 2.4, the Agent Updater could crash when running on a system with a Python interpreter 2.4 or older.

An execution of cmk-update-agent would crash with an error message like:

<pre>
  File "cmk-update-agent", line 694
    with open(get_all_certs_filepath(), "w") as acf:
            ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
</pre>
