Title: Cascading livestatus proxy is now compatible with disabled IP protocols
Level: 1
Component: liveproxy

Class: fix

The livestatus proxy can be configured to cascade livestatus connections. The
feature was introduced with 1.5.0 by werk #5970 which describes how this can be
used.

The livestatus proxy is always trying to open an IPv4 and IPv6 listening
socket.  In previous versions the startup of the livestatus proxy failed with
an error message <tt>MKGeneralException: Cannot create TCP socket :::6560: [Errno 97] Address family not supported by protocol</tt> in <tt>var/log/liveproxyd.log</tt>.

The process now continues if the port could not be opened for the reason that
an address family is not supported. Additionally an informational message is
written to the <tt>var/log/liveproxyd.log</tt>.
