It was possible to inject Javascript code to using configuration fields of different objects
(users, hosts, groups, roles, timeperiods).

These issues could only be triggered by authenticated users that have permissons to use WATO
and add/edit the objects mentioned above. Normally these are users with the roles admin or
users.
