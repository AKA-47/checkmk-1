Title: Windows eventlog: wrong last state saved
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Edition: cre
Version: 1.4.0p17
Date: 1509376514
Class: fix

The initial run of Windows agent after fresh installation caused an
incorrect last state to be written in the state file eventstate.txt.
As a result, no new entries were read from the eventlog. Broken since
1.4.0p13 (commit 24be6456476f8768770eed0e5180026589a938bb).
