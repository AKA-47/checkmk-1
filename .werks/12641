The service description for Dell compellent storage disks contained the internal disk number,
which unfortunately can change between multiple SNMP-requests.
As a result the mapping of disks to services could change and one single disk health status
could be reported to changing services.
The service description was changed to use the "DELL-STORAGE-SC-MIB::scDiskNamePosition", which
contains the enclosure number and the disk number.
This scDiskNamePosition will remain stable across multiple SNMP-requests.
All services of this plugin must be rediscovered.
