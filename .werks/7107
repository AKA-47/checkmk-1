Title: mk_oracle: Support for custom credentials in custom_sqls
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Edition: cre
Version: 1.6.0i1

Class: feature

Dedicated credentials for each section in custom_sqls
could be configured. The following parameters are valid:

my_custom_sql () {
SQLS_DBUSER=customuser
SQLS_DBPASSWORD=secretpwd
SQLS_DBSYSCONNECT="None"
SQLS_TNSALIAS=testdb123

These are the new parameters.
An  important note against SQLS_DBSYSCONNECT:
If sysdba or sysoper has been set in DBUSER inside mk_oracle.cfg, the
SQLS_DBSYSCONNECT="None" is needed to overwrite the default from DBUSER.
This is often needed in environments with connections to mounted
databases.
SQLS_DBSYSCONNECT could be ignored, when sysdba or sysoper is not set in
DBUSER.
