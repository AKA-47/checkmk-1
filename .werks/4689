When importing data from cmcdump into the Check_MK Micro Core, a buffer for
the long plugin output was too small, leading to a buffer overflow with
unpredictable consequences.  The affected COMMANDs on the Livestatus
interface were UPDATE_SHADOW_HOST_STATE and UPDATE_SHADOW_SERVICE_STATE. 
This has been fixed.
