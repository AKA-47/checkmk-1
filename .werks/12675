Title: Error in systemd socket unit
Level: 1
Component: agents
Compatible: incomp
Edition: cee
Version: 1.6.0p24
Date: 1619535587
Class: fix

This is a regression since 1.6.0p23 and Werk #12153.

When installing the Checkmk agent package on Linux systems,
an erroneous systemd socket unit will be installed on the target
system.

If the affected system is actually contacted via systemd, i.e., no
xinetd is installed on the system, this will lead to an inaccessible
host.

In order to recover from this error on affected hosts, you have to
either install the newly baked agent package on the hosts manually,
or, if you are using automatic agent updates, run <tt>cmk-update-agent</tt>
once manually on the hosts, as it won't get triggered via agent call.
