description:
 This check provides information about VMs configured in the Microsoft Azure cloud.

 The check displays the provisioning and power states of the VM, as well as its
 tags and location.

 The service state resulting from the different provisioning and power states can be
 configured using the rule "Azure Virtual Machines".

inventory:
 One service per VM is created, on every Check_MK host that receives information
 about the VMs via the piggyback mechanism.
 To configure which those are, see the configuration of the Azure agent.
