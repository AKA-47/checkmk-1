distribution: check_mk
description:
 The check queries the MIB tables of F5 BIG-IP loadbalancers (local traffic managers) to identify
 if the vCMP guest correctly runs in an {active/active} or an {active/passive} setup.
 You can configure the expected behaviour via a WATO rule.
 It will issue a warning if the cluster setup differs from the expected setup.
