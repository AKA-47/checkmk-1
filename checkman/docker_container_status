description:
 Monitors the status of docker containers. A status of "running" is treated as OK,
 any other status is treated as CRIT.

 To make this check work the agent plugin {{mk_docker.py}} has to be installed.
 If you are using agent bakery rules, you must enable "Piggybacked docker containers".
 If you are configuring the plugin via the configuration file, make sure you do not skip the
 section "docker_containers_client" (the default setting is fine).
