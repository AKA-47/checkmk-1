description:
 This check monitors the memory and swap

 This daemon is mostly found on Linux systems and used by some hardware
 appliances (such as Riverbed Steelhead or Dell EMC ECS).

 Upper default levels are set to 80, 90%. These levels are configurable.
 Note that the check counts memory free, buffered and cached memory as actual free memory, as
 one should for Linux systems.
