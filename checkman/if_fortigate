title: Fortigate devices: Network interfaces via standard MIB using 64 Bit counters
agents: snmp
catalog: hw/network/fortinet
license: GPL
distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check does exactly the same as {if64} but retrieves {ifName} instead
 of {ifAlias}, because {ifAlias} is not useful in Fortigate firewalls.

 Please refer to the if64 manpage for documentation.
