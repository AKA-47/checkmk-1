Title: Password changes are not replicated
Component: wato

When a user changes his password, then that change is not automatically
replicated to the slave sites in replicated mode. I think we'd really
need to do some isolated replication only of htpasswd in that case - 
automatically.

Solution: Create a new webservice that just replicates the password
file. This mini-replication is then automatically done when the
user changes his password.
