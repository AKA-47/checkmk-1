Title: Crash when metric names are garbled
Component: core
Class: bug
State: done
Date: 2016-03-07 14:58:30
Targetversion: 1.2.8

Here is the history of the problem and how to reproduce it:

1. Create an active check of type "SMTP".
2. Modify checks/check_smtp in a way that the command line of the command is
   broken and the usage of lib/nagios/plugins/check_smtp appears

This usage contains a vertical bar:

OMD[heute]:~$ lib/nagios/plugins/check_smtp -6 127.0.0.1
check_smtp: UngÃ¼ltige(r) Hostname/Adresse - 127.0.0.1
Usage:
check_smtp -H host [-p port] [-4|-6] [-e expect] [-C command] [-R response] [-f from addr]
[-A authtype -U authuser -P authpass] [-w warn] [-c crit] [-t timeout] [-q]
[-F fqdn] [-S] [-D warn days cert expire[,crit days cert expire]] [-v] 

That results in being this like 'expire]]' being interpreted as metric name. This
seems to be the first bug IMHO. We need to enforce an '=' being part of a string in
order to be recognized as perf-data.

The this list of metrics will be put into RRDs.

Now fix the SMTP call so that these garbled metrics will not appear in the *current*
metrics. This will trigger an exception in the GUI when you go to the service

This problem seems a separate one and probably always occurs if the current list of
metrics is missing some historic variable.
