Title: Instant reports must not used default report time ranges but those from filters
Component: reporting

Targetversion: 1.2.8

The "Export as PDF" instant reports currently use the default time range
for reports.  But the user expects for time based views like "Events of
Host/Service" that the filters in that view are being used and the same
output as on the screen is put into the PDF.

So for instant reports we need to be able to work without any time range
or set some flag that the report time range should not be enforced but just
used as a default in situations where no other time range is available.

This was already fixed, but still had a bug (misscomputation by one day).
Fixed.
