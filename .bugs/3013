Class: bug

Some pages that rely on Check_MK automation calls are terrible slow. For example
the rule editor of the "Check intervals for SNMP checks" is slow because the
automation call that is used to list the check of Check_MK is called 4 times
when rendering the page. This should really be cached on any layer, maybe in the
valuespec itself.
