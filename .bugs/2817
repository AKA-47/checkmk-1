Title: Adding a host causes a WARNING log entry in cmc.log
Component: core
Class: bug
State: done

Targetversion: 1.2.8

When adding a host and discover the services via WATO a warning message is
written to the CMC log:

 [Analyze this line] 2016-03-29 15:00:44 [5] Executing external command: SCHEDULE_FORCED_SVC_CHECK;localhost;Check_MK Discovery;1459263644

 [Analyze this line] 2016-03-29 15:00:44 [4] Ignoring command SCHEDULE_FORCED_SVC_CHECK;localhost;Check_MK Discovery;1459263644: invalid parameters

This is bad because this log is monitored on the Check_MK appliance by default
and causing a WARNING state.

2016-04-19 16:47:07: changed state open -> done
Fixed.
