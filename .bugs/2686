Title: Delay service notification when host comes up

When a host is DOWN and then a service goes CRIT, the corresponding notification
is put on hold. As soon as the host goes up again the notification seems to be
sent out. But we rather must wait for the next check of the service, in order to
give it a chance to become OK again, after the host is reachable.
