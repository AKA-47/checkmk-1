Title: Too much load on reload/restart due to helper initialization
Component: core
State: open

Targetversion: next
Class: nastiness

During reload or start of the core all helper processes are initialized.
This leads to a lot of load, scaling with the number of helpers. This should
be optimized, for example by removing the initialization during reload or not
initializing all workers at once (initialize in groups of X processes at once)
