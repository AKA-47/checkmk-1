Title: Matching of Texts in EC inconsistent if no regexes are used
Component: ec
State: open
Date: 2017-01-25 14:13:01
Targetversion: 1.5.0
Class: bug

The matching if "app" and "ap[p]" differ - but shouldn't. The EC uses
if different semantic for regexes and fixed strings. This can lead
to strange behaviours. Also a prefix of .* seems to be removed before
the distinction is made. So a match of .*foo seems to be treated jus
like foo.

Investigate this. Maybe we need to migrate existing match strings
in order to stay compabible and fix the problem anyway.

This also affects 1.4.0, 1.2.8 and possibly older version, but we won't change
it in this old versions.
