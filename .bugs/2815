Title: Graph zoom/pan is badly slow when using localized GUI
Component: metrics

Targetversion: 1.2.8

The current Check_MK GUI code initially loads all plugins on each request with "current_language" set to None.
This makes all plugins be loaded in english language. After the user auth checking the user language is known,
so the plugins are reloaded when the users have another language.

This not only decreases performance for localized GUI users but also for non localized users because the
apache processes need to re-initialize the plugins often.
