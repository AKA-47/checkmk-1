Title: Fix broken rule evaluation when using multiple negated hosts
Component: checks
Class: bug
State: done
Date: 2016-11-09 14:46:05
Targetversion: future

The functions wato.py:rule_matches_host_and_item and modules/check_mk.py:in_extraconf_hostlist
can not handle these kind of hostlist ['!heute1', '!heute', '!heute2', '@all']
If a ! is detected, the for loop exits immediately after the checked item.

These conditions specified in WATO do not work: "Host name is not one of heute1, heute or heute2"

Replay issue:
1) Create a rule: Hosts using SNMP bulk walk (enforces SNMP v2c)
2) Setup hosts as mentioned in the example above
3) Navigate to "Parameters of {hostname}"
   Host heute matches, Host heute1 does not match

The problem could only be found in WATO rule analyzer. modules/check_mk.py:in_extraconf_hostlist
is working as expected.
