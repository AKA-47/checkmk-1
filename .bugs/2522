Title: Distributed Monitoring: User action breaks configuration
Component: multisite
Class: bug
State: done
Date: 2016-10-25 12:10:19
Targetversion: 1.2.8

The user is using a distributed monitoring setup with central WATO configuration.
The slave sites are only monitoring a part of the hosts configured on the master and
the site ID is inherited by the folder properties.

Our normal setup will disable WATO on all slave sites. If the user is activating it
or will use our WebAPI or Multisite URLs for adaptations, the configuration is broken.
All hosts will be started to monitor on this slave. It is related to the missing site ID
in our configuration. All unknown site IDs will be replaced with the ID from the slave.

We should take care about the transfered configuration to our slave sites. Those sites should
only receive the configuration which is needed by them.

Otherwise we have to handle the missing site IDs correctly. Any modification on slave sites
should not break the correct configuration.

Workaround:
Please modify global settings of affected slave sites. Edit and save without any change.
After the activation, all slave sites will be updated to the correct configuration.
If the duplicated hosts does not disappear, please login to the slave and do a cmk -R as site user.

This has already been fixed by dealing correctly with the hosts that are not assigned to that
site. These hosts will not be monitored by the slave site anymore.
