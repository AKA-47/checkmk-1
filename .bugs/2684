Title: cmk --keepalive still uses old config after reload
Component: config

I've added some service with WATO and reloaded. The new
services are appearing in the web GUI but keep stale because
the cmk --keepalive apearantly still uses the old configuration.
A second omd reload cmc helped.

MK: I cannot reproduce this though I've seen it once. Any
help for reproducing it is appreciated.

Ursache war wohl rushahead. Jetzt wird dieser immer dann ignoriert
wenn man auf der Kommandozeile -O macht.
