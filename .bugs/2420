Title: Renaming hosts can lead to duplicate host names
Component: wato
Class: bug
State: done

Targetversion: 1.4.0

You have host A in folder F and host B in folder G. Now you can rename
B into A without WATO complaining. You end with two times A - which causes
*lots* of trouble.

We need to check better for duplicate hosts when renaming.
