Title: Cleanup environment handling of OMD sites
Component: core

Targetversion: 1.5.0
Class: bug

There need to be two places where the defined environment of all processes of a OMD
site is set:

a) su - omd
b) omd: set_environment()

su - omd uses the .profile of a site to initialize the environment. Both places
differ and should be unified. Maybe a single central file needs to be created
that holds all the environment variable definitions and both places rely on that
file.

We also should cleanup the different sourcing calls of OMD daemon init scripts.
The calls ". .profile" should be removed. All subprocesses created within a site
need to inherit this defined environment.
