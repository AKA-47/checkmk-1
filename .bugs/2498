Title: WATO-Snapshots should warn if data in local/ is too much
Component: wato
Class: bug
State: done
Date: 2016-07-06 11:43:10
Targetversion: 1.5.0

We had the case that a user pu approx 4GB of tmp data below local/.
During "Activate Changes" WATO creates a snapshot of this. This
took very long and lead to a Apache timeout (proxy error...).

We need to validate the data in local/ somehow. Maybe make size
limit? Or positively check all directories?

----

Solution: We are planning to create some "todo / config and performance hints" 
page that shows a list of things to tune to have a good setup. This page could
make such a local/ directory size check.

This will be part of the upcoming best practices tests.
