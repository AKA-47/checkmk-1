To have a consistent usage of Inline-SNMP we should make cmk --snmpwalk also
use Inline-SNMP code. This is problematic, because this mode saves the values
which come from the command line tools as hex strings in hex format. Inline-SNMP
does not user such hex coded strings so we need to either encode it on our own
or try to deal with this in another way.
