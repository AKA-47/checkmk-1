Title: SSH private key of linux remote handler visible in agent package
Component: agents
State: open
Date: 2017-02-14 15:05:49
Targetversion: 1.2.9
Class: bug

The private SSH key for remote login and execution of remote alert handlers
is part of the agent configuration because it is done in an agent bakery
rule. The configuration is thus shipped in the package information in the
agent and thus visible. This allows admins of host a to execute the remote
agents alert handlers of host b.

Possible fixes:

a) Try to remove just that key from the visiable agent configuration (hack)
b) Remove the information about the configuration totally
c) Use the valuespec totext() for the information rather than repr() (if
   possible)
