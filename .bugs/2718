Title: Empty contact groups are not created -> RBN contact selection fails

If you have a contact group with a number of users but with *no* host
or service, then this contact group will not be created in the monitoring
configuration. This makes problems with the RBN.

If a RBN rule selects a contact group as a contact selection and that
group does not exist then no notifications will be sent.

Solution: also create empty contact groups.
