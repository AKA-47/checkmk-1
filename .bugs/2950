Class: bug

When using the LDAP sync to manage users and contact group memberships one needs to create
the contact groups to be synced from LDAP manually. From the first sync after creation the
group memberships are synchronized by the LDAP sync. Since the membership attribute of
all LDAP users is locked, it is not possible remove the assignment to the group. This makes
it impossible to delete the group while there are LDAP users for this group.

It should be possible to delete the group after confirming a warning message.
