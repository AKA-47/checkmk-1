Title: Huge time ranges crash graph ranges (overflow of unix time)
Component: metrics
Class: bug
State: done
Date: 2016-03-18 15:17:37
Targetversion: 1.2.8

When producing a graph which exceeds the unix time range this produces a graph which
begins e.g. in 2011 and ends in 1996. This situation is not handled correctly. There
should be error handlings for negative (invalid) time ranges.

Fixed in Javascript by detecting overflow
