Title: Reflect "cluster aware" information of checks in man pages
Component: core
State: open

Targetversion: 1.5.0
Class: cleanup

The information whether or not a check is "cluster aware" is
not shown in the man page of a check. We should read the
"node_info" and show the information in the man page.

On command line, the WATO GUI and the web page.
