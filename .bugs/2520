If hosts tags are assigned to hosts and you want to remove a specific host tag in mass edit action of hosts,
it will be not removed. The host tag is stiull assigned to the hosts.

Inheritance of folder host tags does not work if you try to remove the host tags.

----

It is working as expected. What you need to know is that the "bulk edit"
dialog can not be used for removing set attributes. You need to use
the dialog "bulk cleanup" to remove attributes from hosts in bulk.

I improved the description on top of the bulk edit page.
