You want to disable all Services like MSSQL.* and use one rule with a positive outcome.
All services will be disabled.
After that rule you add another one and try to get explizit services again like MSSQL Production$.
That shoudl work with a negative outcome. It will not work. All combinations do not get the result,
that was wished. Disable all services and include only some of them.

Works as expected. The first rule needs to be the "include" rule and the second one
the "exclude" rule.
