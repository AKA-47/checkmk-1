Title: livestatus: perf_data is unquoted, breaks csv output

Class: bug

The livestatus table "services" includes performance data. This data uses
semi-colons as field separators, just like the CSV output of livestatus,
yet perf_data is not quoted. This makes the CSV output un-parseable.

--> Livestatus does not really support CSV, but just separates fields
with ;. Introducing quoting would be an incompatible change. We could
introduce a new header option for that.

But: what the heck. Nobdy uses CSV for real applications. It's just
for small shell hacks. And there the currently implementation is the
easiest to work with.
