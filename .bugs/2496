Title: Folders snaping -> some subfolder -> dashboards -> Globestatistik -> Link in number wrong
Component: multisite
Class: bug

Targetversion: 1.2.8

On a dashboards that shows just a subfolder of WATO the statistics in the
globes print the correct numbers. But a click on such a number seems to
drop the WATO folder filter so the resulting view is global - not for 
the selected folder.

Fixed.
