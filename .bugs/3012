Title: Clarify --no-tcp option: Even when it is named tcp, do we mean data sources in general?

The description in cmk --help says:

   --no-tcp            For -I: Only use cache files. Skip hosts without cache
                       files.


Clarify:

a) Is it really only relevant for -I?
b) These days Check_MK can use a lot of data sources to get monitoring data.
   Doesn't this option mean "don't really contact target system, use caches"?
   In this case we need to handle this in a general way (data_sources.abstract.DataSource.run()),
   not only in the TCPDataSource().

If it's a more generic option. Rename the option and accept the existing one as alias.
