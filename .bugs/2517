Title: Migration from Ubuntu to RedHat with omd backup failed
Component: multisite
Class: bug

Targetversion: 1.2.8

If you create a backup of an existing site with omd backup on a Ubuntu server and do a restore
on a RedHat machine with omd restore, then the site will not be startet. Apache configuration is
wrong, because during the restore the lokale Apache configuration is not reset to system default file.

Workaround:
Replace the include section of modules with default section of another site.

This has been fixed with current versions. The files have been made
more portable so that you don't need to change the module paths
anymore.
