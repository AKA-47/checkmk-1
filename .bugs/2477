Targetversion: 1.5.0
Class: nastiness

There is a annicient and now hidden feature "site icons". The user can set the option
use_siteicons = True in the multisite.mk and put an icon named like this into the
images/icons directory: icons/site-%s-24.png.

This can currently not be configured via WATO. Remove this feature, because this can
be configured using the custom host/service icon feature these days via WATO.
