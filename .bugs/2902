Title: Agent bakery does not use local check plugins

To make this possible we need to abstract the source path for such files from the agent
bakery plugins. We could wrap the paths in a function which detects the real path. Something
like this:

overridable_file_path("check_mk/agents/plugins/...")

In case a local file is available it is used. Otherwise the regular file
below share is used.
