Title: Check cache usage of the HW/SW inventory check

We should check why the inventory check is handled differently than
the discovery check regarding it's cache usage.

The HW/SW inventory check is always trying to fetch fresh SNMP data.
While the inventory check makes use of the existing data source caches.

There are SNMP HW/SW inventory plugins that do not exist as checks and
vice versa. We need to care about this when writing the cache in case
we mix these both.
