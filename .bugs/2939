Title: Export WATO folder permissions breaks activate changes in distributed setups
Component: wato
Class: bug
State: done
Date: 2017-07-18 18:46:33
Targetversion: 1.2.8

If the option Export WATO permissions is activated and around 1400 users are used in
user management, it will break activation of changes. It will end in a apache process
which is running on full power to calculate all the settings for all users.

This option should be blocked if too much users exists or should be better optimized for higer user amounts.

Workaround: Deactivte the option Export WATO permissions
