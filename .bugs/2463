Title: Hosts without site attribute are monitored by all sites
Component: core
Class: bug
State: done
Date: 2016-08-03 11:10:47
Targetversion: 1.2.8

When creating a host manually or with "hole" script, these hosts have no site attribute set. When this is synced
to a slave site, the host is monitored by both sites.

We should detect that and only monitor those hosts on standalone sites or WATO master sites.

This should be fixed in current versions.
