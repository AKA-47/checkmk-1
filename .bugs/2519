Title: Input field of hostname is not a regex input field in configuration rules
Component: wato
Class: bug
State: done
Date: 2016-08-17 19:23:41
Targetversion: 1.2.8

If you create a new rule in WATO for configuration and want to use regex to match hostnames you have to add
the ~(tilde) in front of the hostname to get regex matching.
This inout field should be a regex input field as default.

This is impossible for us to change. What we are planning to do for the 1.5 release
is to visualize the type of the fields better to make the user know which kind of
field he has to fill and to give the user an option to switch the mechanics from
exact host name matching to regex matching by clicking an icon on that field.
