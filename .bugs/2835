Title: Preview of report not refreshed when imported templates change

When you edit something in the default template, which is included by alle
reports, then the previews of those reports are not marked "dirty". That
way you do not get a valid preview thumbnail unless you force some change
on the report itself.

I guess this also happens when changing global settings. Solution could be
some work.
