If you delete a host that is a parent of some other host then
you should not be able to delete that host.

The question is, if deleting of hole folders or even folder trees
should also be validated (complicated). Same holds for bulk delets.
Here we would need to validate the situation after *all*
deletes have been done.

Suggestion: we validate just when deleting one single host.
