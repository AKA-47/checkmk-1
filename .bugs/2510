Title: local active checks
Component: checks
State: open

Targetversion: 1.4.0
Class: bug

The GUI is only using the active checks under ~/lib/nagios/plugins and
not local ones (~/local/lib/nagios/plugins).

-------------------------

The active checks shown on the WATO service page is executed by the
automation "active-check" in modules/automation.py which simply uses
the argument_function defined in checks_check_*.

This seems also affect the regular checks. At least when configuring
active checks with the "active_checks" rule which is used by default
when configuring a formalized active check with WATO. The
checks/check_* files hard code a $USER1$ path to the configuration
which tells Check_MK to use the file found in ~/lib/nagios/plugins.

This affects the CMC. Nagios has not been checked.
