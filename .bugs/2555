Title: Match for contact groups when core = Nagios does not work
Component: notification
Class: bug
State: works4me
Date: 2017-06-08 08:10:56
Targetversion: 1.4.0

When doing notification rules with matching on contact groups
we need the list of contactgroups from the core. These doe
not seem to be present when the core is Nagios so we need
to fetch them via Livestatus. This is not yet implemented.

2017-10-27 08:42:37: changed state open -> works4me
Seems this has been implemented in the meantime. It works as intended.
