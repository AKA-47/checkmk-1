Title: Match for contact groups when core = Nagios does not work
Component: notification
State: open
Date: 2017-06-08 08:10:56
Targetversion: 1.4.0
Class: bug

When doing notification rules with matching on contact groups
we need the list of contactgroups from the core. These doe
not seem to be present when the core is Nagios so we need
to fetch them via Livestatus. This is not yet implemented.
