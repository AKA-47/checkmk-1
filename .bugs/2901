Title: WATO rule edit/delete: Rules are referenced by list index (can delete/edit wrong rule)
Component: wato

Class: bug

When multiple users edit the same ruleset for example by moving deleting rules they can edit wrong rules
by accident. This can happen because the rules are identified by their position in the ruleset list which
is really bad when doing actions with an outdated view.

We either need to store a hash/token of the previous configuration, send it with the edit action and
compare it when applying a new change or we need to add some permanent identity to the rules.
