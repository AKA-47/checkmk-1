Title: Rework setting of environment variables in whole OMD context
Component: core

Targetversion: 1.5.0

Environment variables should only be set in ~/.profile and
will then be inherited by all sub- and subsubprocesses. It
seem that some start scripts explicitely source that file.
It also seems that in some situations not all variables
are correctly inherited.

We need to investigate this, clean this up, remove explizit
sourcing of .profile and streamline this.

All variables should be set just in two places:

1. su - mysite
2. omd ... mysite

All other scripts such auch etc/init.d/* should simply
rely on correct inheritance.
