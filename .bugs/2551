Title: Option -N on omd backup (and om cp) disregards various historic data

It seems that <tt>-N</tt> just skips the monitoring history and the RRDs.
Several possible large files are still handled, e.g.
the EC archive and the HW/SW-Inventory history. Also we could
arguably consider var/log/*.log as historic data and drop
that. Maybe also a git Konfiguration history, WATO snapshots
and other stuff.
