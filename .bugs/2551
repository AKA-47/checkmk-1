Title: Option -N on omd backup (and om cp) disregards various historic data
Component: core

Targetversion: future

It seems that <tt>-N</tt> just skips the monitoring history and the RRDs.
Several possible large files are still handled, e.g.
the EC archive and the HW/SW-Inventory history. Also we could
arguably consider var/log/*.log as historic data and drop
that. Maybe also a git Konfiguration history, WATO snapshots
and other stuff.

---------

In fact the following paths are skipped:

    if "no-rrds" in options or "no-past" in options:
        excludes.append("var/pnp4nagios/perfdata/*")
        excludes.append("var/pnp4nagios/spool/*")
        excludes.append("var/rrdcached/*")
        excludes.append("var/pnp4nagios/states/*")
        excludes.append("var/check_mk/rrd/*")

    if "no-logs" in options or "no-past" in options:
        excludes.append("var/log/*/*")
        excludes.append("var/nagios/nagios.log")
        excludes.append("var/nagios/archive/")
        excludes.append("var/pnp4nagios/log/*")
        excludes.append("var/pnp4nagios/perfdata.dump")
        excludes.append("var/mkeventd/history/*")
        # CMC
        excludes.append("var/check_mk/core/history")
        excludes.append("var/check_mk/core/archive/*")


The help shows the following info:

    Possible options for this command:
     --no-rrds            do not copy RRD files (performance data
     --no-logs            do not copy log files
     -N,--no-past         do not copy RRD file and log files
     --no-compression      do not compress tar archive

The name of the option is a bit missleading, but the help of the options is a
bit clearer. From that description we would not have to add more files.

The question is about the use case: The user may want to have a backup that
is done fast and where the resulting file is small. Assuming this, adding more
files would be good.

We add the following now to the "--no-logs" and "--no-past" options:

var/log/*.log
var/check_mk/inventory_archive/*/*
var/check_mk/wato/snapshots/*.tar
var/check_mk/wato/log/audit.log
