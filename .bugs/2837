Title: Mixture of report context types due to importing templates creates problems
Component: reporting

Class: bug

Create a report with context type "one single host". This automatically inherits
the default template (which has no context). Now add a PNP Graph to the default
template (this is possible). This now results in a strange error, where
{ "host" : "myhost" } is interpreted as host name (the complete dict).
Needs to be investigated. We cannot disallow importing non-context templates
into reports with context. We cannot disallow added elements that have a single
context into contextless reports either.
