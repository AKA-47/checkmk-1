Title: Hosts configured for a multisite only site are monitored on master
Component: wato
Class: bug
State: done
Date: 2016-08-03 11:12:16
Targetversion: 1.2.8

When having the master site connected with another site only in the status world, without
distributed WATO and assigning a host to that site, the host is still monitored by the
master site. The host should simply not be monitored instead.

2017-02-16 17:48:39: changed state open -> done
has already been fixed.
