Title: OMD: LIVESTATUS_TCP_PORT does not check for duplicate ports

The LIVESTATUS_TCP_PORT OMD hook does not try to prevent port number conflicts. Instead
of just using the 6557 port as default it should try to check for the already used ports
and try to gather a free one. Just like the apache port hook.
