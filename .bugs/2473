Title: Virtual host trees should have ids
Component: multisite
Class: bug
State: done
Date: 2016-12-05 13:37:42
Targetversion: 1.2.9

The virtual host trees are currently being referenced by their index. In case a tree is deleted, the
tree that a user references may change because the elements in the list virtual_host_trees have
different indexes now.
