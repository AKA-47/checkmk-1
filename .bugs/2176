Title: logwatch: files with timestamps, initial text missing
Component: checks
State: open

Targetversion: future
Class: bug

If logwatch detects a new logfile it starts at the end of this file.
If a logfile is generated daily with a new timestamp the initial lines
are skipped and error messages might get lost.

The logwatch.cfg needs to be exteded to give the user the option to tell mk_logwatch
that to start from beginning of new files instead from the end of that file

The option could be named e.g. "fromstart"

Todos:

- Add option parsing (line ~500)
- Implementation in process_logfile()
