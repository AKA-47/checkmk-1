Title: Event Console delete icon does not work if checkboxes are enabled

If you activate checkboxes and the use the delete icon for
deleting one event you will run into an error message that
no items are selected. I fear that I some *would* be selected,
then all those would be deleted instead of just that one
where the icon was clicked.
