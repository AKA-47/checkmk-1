Title: Notification while Downtime

We had the following sitatuion:

A downtime on the services for the OMD-Builds until 8:00. But also the 
check-period for these services starts at 8:00. Now - when the buidls
were repaired, exactly at 8:00 these checks went from CRIT to OK
and the Downtime ended. But we got *two* notifications.

Downtime End (while OK) and CRITICAL â†’ OK.

If the alert was still during the downtime, then no notif. should
have happend for that. But during the "Downtime End" notification,
the status *was* already OK - as stated in the notifikcation itself.

How can this happen?

Eigentlich passt das Verhalten so.
