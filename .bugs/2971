Title: Activate Changes fails after update if some host with an deprecated check is down
Component: checks
State: open
Date: 2017-10-06 11:12:29
Targetversion: 1.4.0
Class: bug

To reproduce the bug:
- Create site with version 1.2.8 or earlier
- Configure a host with a postfix service (postfix_mailq)
- Cut the connection to the host (services will be stale)
- update to 1.4.0
- create a rule for the postfix service (Number of mails in outgoing mail queue)
- Activate Changes

It seems, that the autochecks.mk is not updated, if the agent_data of a host is not reachable.
