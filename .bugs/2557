Title: Notification setting for event console events
Component: notification
State: open
Date: 2017-02-20 12:22:24
Targetversion: 1.2.8
Class: bug

The setting Event Console alerts in the notification rules is not used as expected.
If you select this option, it shows the option Do not match Event Console alerts.
That should be the system standard.
Unfortunately we accept all events from Event Console as standard.
We have to specify it explicit to ignore those messages.
We should add a new option to tell the user, All Event Console alerts will be processed.
