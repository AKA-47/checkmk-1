Title: Process error messages of helper processes
Component: core
Class: todo
State: done

Targetversion: next

The errors produced by helpers, especially check helpers, needs
to be processed to make the diagnose of problems easiert.

fd 2 should be used as channel from the helper to cmc for transporting
the errors. The helper can then simply output errors on stderr and
eventuall also change stdout to write to stderr to get all information
into the core.

The cmc should then log the produced outputs. This should be disabled
by default and configurable by WATO using a single rule to configure
a dict of options

a) Write helper errors to core log
b) Execute helpers in verbose mode
c) Execute helpers in debug mode
