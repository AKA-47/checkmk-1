Title: Addding a host's AV-table or host's view behave differently

If you add the availability table of a host to a report via the context menu,
then the selected host is *not* added to the report element as context value.

If you add a view of a host on the other hand the selected host is
added and hardcoded into the element.

We need to decide how this should be done in general.

If are at a host and add something to a report with a host context, then
IMHO the host should not be hard coded. If you add it to a global report
the it should. If this is too complicated then it always should be added.
