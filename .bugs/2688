Title: Service notifications may happen while host is down
Component: core
Class: bug
State: done

Targetversion: next

The reason is not yet clear. Here is one incident from our own monitoring:

Check_MK: Fritzbox-1und1 - PROBLEM
Object Information
Name     Fritzbox-1und1 (Fritzbox-1und1)
Address     10.1.1.6
State
State     UP â†’ DOWN (PROBLEM) since 0d 00:00:01
Output     No IP packet received for 15.518 sec (dead line is 15.000 sec)

During that phase service notifications appeared.

Also: When:

Host -> DOWN
Service -> CRIT
Host -> UP

-> Now a service notification is immediately being sent out. But we need to wait for
at least one service check.

Denke, das war ein doppeltes von #68 und sollte jetzt behoben sein.
