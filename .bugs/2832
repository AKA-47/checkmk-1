Title: Notification delay can lead to OK notifications without prior CRIT notifications
Component: core
State: open

Targetversion: master
Class: nastiness

If you use first notification delay and during the delay phase a service
goes OK again then the core has no knowledge whether a notification for CRIT
already has been sent. It always sends the OK notification. Can we fix this
and safely determine wether CRIT was alarmed and thus needs to be mirrored
by an OK notification? Maybe by using some timestamp?
