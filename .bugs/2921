Targetversion: 1.2.8

If a customers uploads its own icons in 1.2.8p18, all icons will be save with the local upload path as
file name.

For example:
C:\Users\Username\Documents\Icons\service.png will be stored in Check_MK like
~/local/share/check_mk/web/htdocs/images/icon/C:\\Users\\Username\\Documents\\Icons\\service.png

Those icons are not shown to the customer.
