Title: Old host rrd directory is created even when using new one
Component: core
Class: bug
State: done
Date: 2016-04-05 17:04:56
Targetversion: 1.4.0

Unsure where the issue is located, but what happens is:

- omd-vonheute
- adding new host via WATO
- reload config
- var/pnp4nagios/perfdata/[hostname] is created

This is done even when var/check_mk/rrd/[hostname] is used
for storing the RRD files.

----

This is done by Perfdatabase::getPNPBase() which class makeDirectory(base).
TODO(sp): Please investigate and clean this up.
