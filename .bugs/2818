Title: Old host rrd directory is created even when using new one
Component: core
State: open
Date: 2016-04-05 17:04:56
Targetversion: 1.2.8
Class: bug

Unsure where the issue is located, but what happens is:

- omd-vonheute
- adding new host via WATO
- reload config
- var/pnp4nagios/perfdata/[hostname] is created

This is done even when var/check_mk/rrd/[hostname] is used
for storing the RRD files.
