Title: Handle timeouts for graphite updates more gracefully
Component: core
Class: nastiness
State: done

Targetversion: next

If you configure Graphite updates and the server does not respond,
then the core runs into lenghty TCP timeouts and the complete
monitoring hangs - including Livestatus.

Either create an own thread for the carbon updates,
or launch a proxy process as OMD script (?)
or impose slower timeouts for connect and send to
the socket.
