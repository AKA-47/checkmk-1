Title: Host with datasource program should not be force to have an IP address

Class: bug

You have a host that is monitored via a datasource program. This
host has no DNS resolvable name, which is no problem sind Check_MK
does not need to do a TCP connect.

Nevertheless during the discovery Check_MK trries a DNS lookup
and fails. But it should known that no IP adress is neccessary
(since the datasource program command line does not contain <tt>&lt;IP&gt;</tr>.
During the failed DNS lookup the datasource program is not
being called.

Better would be to use "" or 0.0.0.0 as an IP address instead.
