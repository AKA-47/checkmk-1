Title: Acknowledgement is not removed, if service goes to OK state
Component: core
Class: bug
State: done
Date: 2013-07-01 11:59:41
Targetversion: next

service is in a non-OK state
state is being acknowledged by some user
admin fixes problem and service goes to OK again
The acknowledged flag is not removed!!

This leads to situations, where nobody cares about a problem because everyone thinks
there is already someone working on, if the service at some later time gets some problem again.

Fixed. Sollte jetzt genau wie in Nagios funktionieren.
