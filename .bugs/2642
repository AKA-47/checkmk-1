when running OMD with Nagios Core, I can issue a
lq "GET services\nColumns: host_name description action_url action_url_expanded\nFilter: host_name = localhost\nFilter: description = Check_MK"

and it reports

localhost;Check_MK;/i4/pnp4nagios/index.php/graph?host=$HOSTNAME$&srv=$SERVICEDESC$' class='tips' rel='/i4/pnp4nagios/index.php/popup?host=$HOSTNAME$&srv=$SERVICEDESC$;/i4/pnp4nagios/index.php/graph?host=localhost&srv=Check_MK' class='tips' rel='/i4/pnp4nagios/index.php/popup?host=localhost&srv=Check_MK

when running with cmd and issuing the same query, I get

localhost;Check_MK;;

the same for the hots table
Query:
lq "GET hosts\nColumns: host_name action_url action_url_expanded\nFilter: host_name = localhost"

Answer with Nagios core:
localhost;/i4/pnp4nagios/index.php/graph?host=$HOSTNAME$&srv=_HOST_' class='tips' rel='/i4/pnp4nagios/index.php/popup?host=$HOSTNAME$&srv=_HOST_;/i4/pnp4nagios/index.php/graph?host=localhost&srv=_HOST_' class='tips' rel='/i4/pnp4nagios/index.php/popup?host=localhost&srv=_HOST_

Answer with CMC:
localhost;;

action_url works if explicitely set. It's just the case that the action_url is not set
to the logwatch URL when using the CMC since Multisite automatically displays the
logwatch Icon even without the URL. And that way the URL is free for custom use.
