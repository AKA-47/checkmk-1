Title: CMC confuses old and new RRD paths leading to empty graphs
Component: core
Class: bug
State: wontfix
Date: 2016-03-29 15:14:08
Targetversion: 1.2.8

When having RRD data in the PNP path var/pnp4nagios/perfdata and a .xml file
is removed and the core is restarted, the existing RRD file in the var/pnp4nagios/perfdata
path is not be used for displaying the graph anymore. Instead a new rrd file
below var/check_mk/rrd is created.

Is this really intended?

Is intended that way.
