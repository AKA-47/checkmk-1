Title: Manually defined log level for web.log is not used
Component: wato
Class: bug
State: works4me
Date: 2017-09-22 10:36:07
Targetversion: 1.4.0

If the log level is set manually in WATO nothing changes in the global.mk. It
seems that the setting is not used at all.

2017-10-04 07:49:37: changed state open -> works4me
The setting "User Interface > Logging" is stored in etc/check_mk/multisite.d/wato/global.mk by saving the option log_levels. It works as expected in 1.4 and master.
