Targetversion: 1.4.0

If you set up a distributed monitoring environment with a central notification instance on master site.
After activating mknotifyd and activate the listener port on the master, this setting will automatically
synchronized to all slave sites. A user have to modify each sitespecific global settings to deactivate
the listener and add the connection to the master.
This global setting should not be synchronized to all slaves.

We have introduced the site specific globals for the local site. With this change it is now possible
to configure individual settings for the central site. The "global settings" now act as what they
are named: global defaults.

The central site specific option to enable the port listener should be set in the central site
specific global settings.
