Title: WATO Backup not working in distributed environments
Component: wato
State: open
Date: 2017-01-24 12:05:22
Targetversion: future
Class: nastiness

Neither is the backup configuration distributed via D-WATO nor
is the Backup module usable in the slave sites. Anyway the
restore of a slave wouldn't work.

The only possible solution seems to delcare the Backup module
als "always local" and allow access to that module even if
using WATO on slave sites is disabled.
