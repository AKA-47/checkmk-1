Title: Adding a view to a report ships unneccessary filters

Try this: go to the view "host" of some host. Add this to a report using
the small button at the bottom of the page.

This view will now be added including the two context filters "Service"
and "Service State". Both are inactive and unncessary, however. Only
active filters should be added.

This has already been fixed.
