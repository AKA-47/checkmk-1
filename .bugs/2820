Title: New graphing system ignores render_scale attribute
Component: web

Targetversion: 1.2.8

The render_scale attribute is supposed to be applied to the measure whenever
the value is displayed to the user. This works in the pnp graphs but not in the
new graphing system.  The attribute is currently only used in the "ratio" unit.

2016-02-16 11:15:00: changed state open -> done
render_scale has now completely been abandoned
