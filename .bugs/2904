One problem is that the elements of the dictionaries written to the configuration
files are not sorted. When one element changes it may happen that all other elements
are also saved in a different order.

We should find a solution for writing out those config files with a deterministic
order of dict keys. Maybe we can use the pprint module to print out dicts with
sorted keys. But we need to have a look at the performance since pprint may be
pretty slow.
