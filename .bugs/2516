At the moment there is no warning, if a site connection is changed from
"Slave" to "No replication". Configured hosts on the master site still
persists even if the slave site is not available anymore. You will need to
manually change the attribute "Monitored on site" on all hosts which did
belong to the slave site. Otherwise you are not able to remove them.
